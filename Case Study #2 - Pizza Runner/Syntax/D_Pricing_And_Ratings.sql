-- D. PRICING AND RATINGS --
----------------------------

-- 1. If a Meat Lovers pizza costs $12 and Vegetarian costs $10 and there were no charges for changes
-- how much money has Pizza Runner made so far if there are no delivery fees?

SELECT 
    SUM(CASE
        WHEN p.pizza_name = 'Meatlovers' THEN 12
        ELSE 10
    END) AS money_earned
FROM
    customer_orders_temp c
        JOIN
    pizza_names p ON c.pizza_id = p.pizza_id
        JOIN
    runner_orders_temp r ON c.order_id = r.order_id
WHERE
    r.cancellation IS NULL;


-- 2.What if there was an additional $1 charge for any pizza extras?
-- Add cheese is $1 extra

SELECT 
    138 + SUM(CASE
        WHEN p.topping_name = 'Cheese' THEN 2
        ELSE 1
    END) AS updated_money
FROM
    extrasBreak e
        JOIN
    pizza_toppings p ON e.extra_id = p.topping_id;


-- 3. The Pizza Runner team now wants to add an additional ratings system that allows customers to rate their runner, 
-- how would you design an additional table for this new dataset - generate a schema for this new table and 
-- insert your own data for ratings for each successful customer order between 1 to 5.

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ratings (
    order_id INT,
    rating INT
);
INSERT INTO ratings (order_id, rating)
VALUES 
  (1,3),
  (2,5),
  (3,3),
  (4,1),
  (5,5),
  (7,3),
  (8,4),
  (10,3);
  
  
-- 4. Using your newly generated table - can you join all of the information together to form a table which has the following information for successful deliveries?
-- customer_id, order_id, runner_id, rating, order_time, pickup_time, Time between order and pickup, Delivery duration, Average speed, Total number of pizzas

SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    c.order_id,
    r.runner_id,
    c.order_time,
    r.pickup_time,
    TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE,
        c.order_time,
        r.pickup_time) AS mins_difference,
    r.duration,
    ROUND(AVG(r.distance / r.duration * 60), 1) AS avg_speed,
    COUNT(c.order_id) AS pizza_count
FROM
    customer_orders_temp c
        JOIN
    runner_orders_temp r ON r.order_id = c.order_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id , c.order_id , r.runner_id , c.order_time , r.pickup_time , r.duration;


-- 5. If a Meat Lovers pizza was $12 and Vegetarian $10 fixed prices with no cost for extras 
-- and each runner is paid $0.30 per kilometre traveled - how much money does Pizza Runner have left over after these deliveries?

SELECT 
    138 AS revenue,
    ROUND(SUM(distance) * 0.3, 2) AS runner_paid,
    ROUND(138 - SUM(distance) * 0.3, 2) AS money_left
FROM
    runner_orders_temp;
