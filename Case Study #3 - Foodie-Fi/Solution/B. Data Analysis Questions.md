    plan_id = 0
GROUP BY MONTH(start_date)

	SUM(CASE WHEN p.plan_name = 'churn' THEN 1 END) AS churn_count, 
    CAST(100*SUM(CASE WHEN p.plan_name = 'churn' THEN 1 END) AS FLOAT) / COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS churn_pct
FROM
	subscriptions s
		JOIN

)

SELECT 
	COUNT(*) AS churn_after_trial,
	ROUND(100*COUNT(*) / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM subscriptions)) AS pct
FROM 
	nextPlan
WHERE plan_name = 'trial' 
  AND next_plan = 'churn';
```

SELECT 
  plan_id,
  plan_name,
  COUNT(*) AS customers,
  CAST(100*COUNT(*) AS FLOAT) 
      / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM subscriptions) AS conversion_rate
FROM plansDate
WHERE (next_date IS NOT NULL AND (start_date < '2020-12-31' AND next_date > '2020-12-31'))
  OR (next_date IS NULL AND start_date < '2020-12-31')
GROUP BY plan_id, plan_name
ORDER BY plan_id;
```
| plan_id | plan_name     | customers | conversion_rate  |
|---------|---------------|-----------|------------------|
| 0       | trial         | 19        | 1.9              |

    COUNT(DISTINCT s.customer_id) AS upgraded_customers
FROM
    subscriptions s
        JOIN
    plans p ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
WHERE
    YEAR(s.start_date) = 2020
        AND p.plan_name LIKE '%annual%';
```
| upgraded_customers |
|--------------------|

### 9. How many days on average does it take for a customer to an annual plan from the day they join Foodie-Fi?
```MySQL
WITH trialPlan AS (
  SELECT 
    s.customer_id,
    s.start_date AS trial_date
  FROM 
	subscriptions s
		JOIN 
	plans p ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
  WHERE p.plan_name = 'trial'
),

annualPlan AS (
  SELECT 
    s.customer_id,
    s.start_date AS annual_date
  FROM 
	subscriptions s
		JOIN 
	plans p ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
  WHERE p.plan_name = 'pro annual'
)

SELECT 
  ROUND(AVG(CAST(TIMESTAMPDIFF(DAY, trial_date, annual_date) AS FLOAT))) AS avg_days_to_annual
FROM 
	trialPlan t
		JOIN 
	annualPlan a ON t.customer_id = a.customer_id;
```
| avg_days_to_annual  |
|---------------------|
| 105                 |

On average, it takes 105 days for a customer to an annual plan from the day they join Foodie-Fi.

### 10. Can you further breakdown this average value into 30 day periods (i.e. 0-30 days, 30-60 days etc)?
```MySQL
WITH trialPlan AS (
  SELECT 
	s.customer_id, 
	s.start_date AS trial_date
  FROM 
	subscriptions s
  WHERE plan_id = 0
),
annualPlan AS (
  SELECT 
    s.customer_id, 
    s.start_date AS annual_date
  FROM 
	subscriptions s
  WHERE plan_id = 3
),
bins AS (
  SELECT 
   FLOOR(TIMESTAMPDIFF(DAY, tp.trial_date, ap.annual_date) / 30) + 1 AS avg_months_to_upgrade
  FROM 
   trialPlan tp
	  JOIN annualPlan ap ON tp.customer_id = ap.customer_id
)
  
SELECT 
    CONCAT(((avg_months_to_upgrade - 1) * 30),
            ' - ',
            (avg_months_to_upgrade * 30),
            ' days') AS breakdown,
    COUNT(*) AS customer_count
FROM
    bins
GROUP BY avg_months_to_upgrade
ORDER BY avg_months_to_upgrade;
```
| breakdown    | customer_count  |
|--------------|-----------------|
| 0-30 days    | 48              |
| 30-60 days   | 25              |
| 60-90 days   | 33              |
| 90-120 days  | 35              |
| 120-150 days | 43              |
| 150-180 days | 35              |
| 180-210 days | 27              |
| 210-240 days | 4               |
| 240-270 days | 5               |
| 270-300 days | 1               |

### 11. How many customers downgraded from a pro monthly to a basic monthly plan in 2020?
```MySQL
WITH nextPlan AS (
  SELECT 
    s.customer_id,
    s.start_date,
    p.plan_name,
    LEAD(p.plan_name) OVER(PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY p.plan_id) AS next_plan
  FROM subscriptions s
  JOIN plans p ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
)

SELECT 
    COUNT(*) AS pro_to_basic_monthly
FROM
    nextPlan
WHERE
    plan_name = 'pro monthly'
        AND next_plan = 'basic monthly'
        AND YEAR(start_date) = 2020;
```
| pro_to_basic_monthly|
|---------------------|
| 0                   |

There were no customers downgrading from a pro monthly to a basic monthly plan in 2020.
