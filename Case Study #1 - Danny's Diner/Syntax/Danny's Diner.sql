ORDER BY points DESC;

-- BONUS QUESTIONS
-- 1. Join All The Things - Recreate the table with: customer_id, order_date, product_name, price, member (Y/N)
SELECT 
    s.customer_id,
    s.order_date,
    m.product_name,
    m.price,

        LEFT JOIN
    menu m ON s.product_id = m.product_id
        LEFT JOIN
    members mem ON s.customer_id = mem.customer_id;


/* 2. Rank All The Things - Danny also requires further information about the ranking of customer products, 
   but he purposely does not need the ranking for non-member purchases.
   so, he expects null ranking values for the records when customers are not yet part of the loyalty program. */
